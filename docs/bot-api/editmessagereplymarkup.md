#### editMessageReplyMarkup

Use this method to edit only the reply markup of messages. On success, if the edited message is not an inline message, the edited [Message](https://core.telegram.org/bots/api#message) is returned, otherwise *True* is returned. Note that business messages that were not sent by the bot and do not contain an inline keyboard can only be edited within **48 hours** from the time they were sent.
