| Field | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| file_id | String | Identifier for this file, which can be used to download or reuse the file |
| file_unique_id | String | Unique identifier for this file, which is supposed to be the same over time and for different bots. Can't be used to download or reuse the file. |
| duration | Integer | Duration of the audio in seconds as defined by the sender |
| mime_type | String | *Optional*. MIME type of the file as defined by the sender |
| file_size | Integer | *Optional*. File size in bytes. It can be bigger than 2^31 and some programming languages may have difficulty/silent defects in interpreting it. But it has at most 52 significant bits, so a signed 64-bit integer or double-precision float type are safe for storing this value. |
